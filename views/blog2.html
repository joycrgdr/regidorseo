                         <p>Developing an SEO Strategy. SEO is short for "search engine optimization." To have your site optimized for the search engines means to attempt to have top placement in the results pages whenever a specific keyword is typed into the query box.</p><br>
                              <h3>SEO AND SEM</h3>
                              <p>SEO is essentially a component of the larger category, SEM. According to Google’s Knowledge Graph, search engine optimization is “the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.” <br>The main difference between these two terms is that search engine optimization is simply a component of search engine marketing. As mentioned above, SEM includes components of paid search, such as PPC and also SMM (social media marketing). It is important to note that you should never use the terms SEO and SEM interchangeably, because although they work hand in hand, they are not the same term.</p>

                              <h3>Kinds of Strategies</h3><br>
                              <p><u>Domain Names</u><br>This is the unique, human-readable Internet addresses of websites. They are made up of three parts: a top-level domain (sometimes called an extension or domain suffix), a domain name (or IP address), and an optional subdomain. The combination of only the domain name and top-level domain is known as a "root domain." The "http://" is part of a page's URL but not its domain name and is known as the "protocol." Search engines do use the keywords in domain names as a ranking factor (which explains the existence of domains like "where-to-buy-the-best-donuts-in-Seattle.com"), but tread lightly when thinking about optimizing your root domain for search engines: One of the specific functions of Google's algorithm is to combat these keyword-stuffed exact-match domains.<br><br>
                              <u>Linking</u><br>A solid link building strategy is key for reaching SEO success. There are many different approaches you can take towards SEO link building, and we’ve organized an assortment of various link building techniques to help you with your SEO strategy. Improve your link building strategy with these link building tips and tricks. Read through and follow these guides and you’ll have a full-fledged link building campaign up and running in no time.<br><br><u>Keyword</u><br>This are essential to developing winning search engine marketing campaigns. Your keyword strategy should involve selecting high-performing keywords that drive relevant traffic to your business. Choosing the right keywords for advertising can make all the difference in your campaigns, determining how well your advertisements rank on Google and other search engine platforms. The best keyword strategies rely on highly relevant keywords, which are keywords that relate closely to your business or are associated with your industry.<br><br>
                              <u>Title Tags</u><br>This are part of the meta tags that appear at the top of your HTML inside the < head> area. Think of title tags like the title of the chapter of a book. It tells people and search engines what your page is about. Title tags are also part of what makes people decide whether to visit your site when it shows up in the search results. The title tag should contain important keywords to help the search engine determine what the page is about.<br><br><u>Meta Description</u><br>This are HTML attributes that provide concise summaries of webpages. They commonly appear underneath the blue clickable links in a search engine results page.<br><br><u>Search Engine Indexing</u><br>It is the process of a search engine collecting, parses and stores data for use by the search engine. The actual search engine index is the place where all the data the search engine has collected is stored. It is the search engine index that provides the results for search queries, and pages that are stored within the search engine index that appear on the search engine results page. Without a search engine index, the search engine would take considerable amounts of time and effort each time a search query was initiated, as the search engine would have to search not only every web page or piece of data that has to do with the particular keyword used in the search query, but every other piece of information it has access to, to ensure that it is not missing something that has something to do with the particular keyword.
